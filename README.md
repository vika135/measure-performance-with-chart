This is _completely useless_ project. The essence of this project is to draw chart of performance of binary search in comparision with linear search.

But this is not main purpose of this project. I created it to train my frontend skills.

So, I used in this project:
- Node.js + Express to create static files server
- Webpack to bundle source code
- Typescript
- Chart.js for charts
- binary search algorithm
